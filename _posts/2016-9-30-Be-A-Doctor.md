title: Why do I choose to be a doctor?

"Challenges are what make life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful. --Joshua J. Marine"


Why do I choose to be a doctor? My dream is to invent a technology allowing people to define their own world, such as customized virtual agents creation, and eventually allowing me to immerse myself in a new world where I create figures, scenes and the whole world. In this world maybe I no longer be a girl, no longer be a Chinese, no longer live in this century. I really love the real world, but experiencing other people's life is just like Sirens' song.

In order to achieve all of these, research is the best way I can think of. Nowadays this technology is still full of obstacles, such as latency, distortion, fatigue. But I will be very glad to devote my whole life to promote its development.

Because of my clear research direction I really need a career full of flexibility. Be a faculty in top universities or a researcher in top companies is my optimal choice and the both recommend a PhD degree.

In addition, PhD is not only a degree, but also an indicator of challenging life. Keeping sedate and enthusiastic in face of difficulties and delving into one field to become an expert is the surprised gift PhD will give me.
