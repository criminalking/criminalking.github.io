"Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world. --Einstein"


As I saw this artwork "Phenomenon of Floating", I was so excited.

The author is extremely creative, he draws a two-dimensional world. You can see a woman floating through a calm lake into mysterious space. The sphere on the top is both sky and earth. The clouds transform into continents, while the trees on the left turn to stars on the right. Although full of differences you feel surprisingly harmonious.

The World has so many different ways to be explained. Nothing is truely right or wrong. All of them just have one attribute, existence. "Only in the state does man have a rational existence." And existence makes the world harmonious, because latent connections exist between all existences.
