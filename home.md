Hello, my name is Conny Lu, and I am a senior undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, graduating July of 2017 with a B.E degree in Automation(EECS). This is my [CV]({{ "Resume_LuXinran.pdf" | relative_url }}). Now I am working with Prof. [Yebin Liu](http://media.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/liuyebin.jsp) in Broadband Network & Digital Media Lab.

### Research Interests

My research interests are `VR/AR/MR`, `computer graphics`(including animation, 3D reconstruction, rendering and virtual environment) and `visual neuroscience`. My most work projects focused on Computer vision, e.g. image matting, hand recognition, pose estimation, and neural style. Now I change slightly my direction to computer graphics and do a project about automatic rigging and character animation.

### Career Plan




### Dream

I wish to immerse myself in a "`generated world`" where I create figures, scenes and the whole world by myself, interact with virtual agents and experience other people's life. Helping other people to define their own world(some people maybe only want to add some elements in their world) is the next step. `Enter Into Virtuality` is my greatest and only hope.
