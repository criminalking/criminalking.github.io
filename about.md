Hello, my name is Conny Lu, and I am a senior undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, graduating July of 2017 with a B.Eng degree in Automation.

### Interests

My interests are computer graphics(including photorealistic rendering, virtual and augmented reality, animation) and brain science. However, my work experiences focus on image matting, image processing and neural style.

### Dream

I wish to go another "`real world`" where I create figures, scenes and whole story by myself. My greatest and only hope is to go into this world without perceiving that I am in a "`fictitious world`".


### Contact me

If you have the similar dream with me or you can give me some advices or you have problems, please contact me.
