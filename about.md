Hello, my name is Conny Lu, and I am a third year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill advised by Prof. [Henry Fuchs](http://henryfuchs.web.unc.edu/) in UNC Graphics and Virtual Reality group. I received my BS degree in Automation from Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Yebin Liu](http://media.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/liuyebin.jsp) in Broadband Network & Digital Media Lab.

### Research Interests

My research interests are mainly **VR/AR** and **Computer Graphics**(including 3D reconstruction, rendering, and virtual environment). Now I'm working on combining virtual human with VR/AR and trying to create a high-fidelity user-specific human face with the high-precision tracked gaze. **Visual Neuroscience** and **Artificial Intelligence** also fascinate me a lot. My previous projects focused on Computer Graphics (e.g. 3D reconstruction, character animation, 3D pose estimation) and Computer Vision (e.g. image matting, neural style).

### Dream

I wish to immerse myself in a "generated world" where I create characters, scenes, and the whole world by myself, interact with virtual agents, and experience a different life. Helping other people to design their virtual world(VR) or combine virtual elements with the real world(AR) is my passion. "Enter Into Virtuality" is my ultimate goal and also what I will dedicate my entire life to.

### Geek

One of my classmates and I made a Light Cube in our junior year after learning an interesting course called Digital Electronics. We also used this Light Cube to show different patterns, such as his ex-girlfriend's name. :)

### Hobbies

There is no doubt that my biggest hobby is anime. Since I started watching "Detective Conan" in the third grade, I have been obsessed with anime for more than ten years. Mystery (e.g. Detective Conan, Death Note, Psychic Detective Yakumo) and blood/battle anime(e.g. Attack on Titan, Naruto, BLEACH) are my favorite. <br>
Below is an image of RIVAL(a character in *Attack on Titan*) and me.

One of my other interests is dancing. I tried almost all kinds of dances, popping, hip-hop, jazz, locking, etc. My favorite one is popping, it is soooooo cool!!! People DANCE LIKE ROBOTS OR PUPPETS!!! <br>
Here's a fantastic [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihx1BO7_Jvc)!

### Life

I have learned German for 6 years in my middle school and passed the DSD C1 examination. In tenth grade, I spent one semester in Goettingen, Germany as an exchange student(Austauschschueler), where I met a lot of fantastic people. I will never forget that time! <br>
Below is the beautiful wall of my exchange Germany high school.
