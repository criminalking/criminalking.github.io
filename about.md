Hello, my name is Conny Lu, and I am a senior undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, graduating July of 2017 with a B.Eng degree in Automation. This is my [CV]({{ "Resume_LuXinran.pdf" | relative_url }}).

### Interests

My interests are `VR/AR/MR`, `computer graphics`(including photorealistic rendering, animation, virtual environment) and `visual neuroscience`. My work projects focus on image matting, hand recognition, pose estimation, and neural style.

### Dream

I wish to immerse myself in a "`generated world`" where I create figures, scenes and the whole world by myself, interact with virtual agents and experience other people's life. Helping other people to define their own world(some people maybe only want to add some elements in their world) is the next step. `Escape From Reality, Enter Into Virtuality` is my greatest and only hope.

### Contact me

If you have the similar dream with me or you want to give me some advices or you have problems, please contact me.
