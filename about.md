Hello, my name is Xinran(Conny) Lu, and I am a senior undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, graduating July of 2017 with a B.E degree in Automation(EECS). This is my [CV]({{ "Resume_LuXinran.pdf" | relative_url }}). Now I am working with Prof. [Yebin Liu](http://media.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/liuyebin.jsp) in Broadband Network & Digital Media Lab.

### Research Interests

My research interests are mainly **VR/AR/MR** and **Computer Graphics**(including animation, 3D reconstruction, rendering and virtual environment). **Visual Neuroscience** and **Artificial Intelligence** also fascinate me a lot. My most work projects focused on Computer Vision, e.g. image matting, hand recognition, and neural style. Now I change slightly my direction to Computer Graphics and I am doing a project about automatic rigging and character animation.

### Dream

I wish to immerse myself in a "generated world" where I create figures, scenes and the whole world by myself, interact with virtual agents and experience other people's life. Helping other people to define their own world(some people maybe only want to add some elements in their world) is the next step. "Enter Into Virtuality" is my greatest and only hope.

### Geek

One of my classmates and I made a Light Cube in our second year of college after learning an interesting course called Digital Electronics. We also used this Light Cube to show different patterns, such as his ex-girlfriend's name. HAHAHA...

### Hobbies

There is no doubt that my biggest hobby is manga. Since I watched "Detective Conan" in the third grade of elementary school, I am crazy about manga for more than ten years. I especially love mystery (e.g. Detective Conan, Death Note, Psychic Detective Yakumo) and blood/battle manga(e.g. Attack on Titan, Naruto, BLEACH). <br>
Below is an image of RIVAL(a character in *Attack on Titan*) and me.

One of my other interests is street dance. I try all kinds of street dances, popping, hiphop, jazz, locking, zumba, etc. My favorite one is popping, it is soooooo cool!!! People DANCE LIKE ROBOTS OR PUPPETS!!! <br>
Here's a fantastic [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihx1BO7_Jvc)!

### Special Experience

I have learned German for 6 years in my middle school and past the DSD C1 examination. At the first year in the high school, I spent one term in Goettingen, Germany as an exchange student(Austauschschueler). That was a very happy and easy time. I met a lot of interesting people and I love Germany kids very much! <br>
