## Motion Capture and Character Animation

`3/2017 - present` <br>
`Lab work, advised by Yebin Liu, Department of Automation, Tsinghua Univeristy`

* System: Mac OS X 10.12 <br>
* Programming Language: c++/Python/Matlab

In this project, I capture human motion from a video and then embed it into a static 3D scan human body(We scan human body using our lab's approach) to make this body move. Hopefully I can put this moving character into **VR HMD**. This is amazing!!! I am working now!!! <br>
To be continued...

## Pose Imitation of Robot in ROS System

`7/2016 - 9/2016` <br>
`Research intern, advised by Yuhao Lu, Turing Robot`

* System: Ubuntu 16.04 <br>
* Programming Language: c++/Python

In this project, I teach robot to imitate human movement(dance) in real-time and then let them teach children dance, which is inspired by my interest in street dance "popping"(i.e. "robot dance"). So we developed a pose estimation system with binocular camera in ROS platform.

* Proposed an algorithm to locate people, match ICP, extract skeleton and compute similarity <br>
* Implemented a 3D body model composed of 10 main body parts to improve results <br>
* Ran at ~5-10 frames per second—the rate of a standard PC—and achieved an accuracy over 90%, thus satisfied the requirements of the industry

(Robots are being produced now. Unfortunately no images are allowed.)

## Offline Ray tracing(Course Work)

`11/2016 - 1/2017` <br>
`Advanced Computer Graphics's Course Work`

* System: Mac OS X 10.12 <br>
* Programming Language: c++

In this project, I built a system to complete Monto Carlo Ray Tracing.

* Implemented circle, rectangle, and triangle mesh, support texture mapping
* Completed diffuse reflection, specular reflection and refraction
* Used KD-tree to accelerate

## Neural Color Transfer

`9/2016 - 12/2016` <br>
`Lab work, advised by Songhai Zhang, Department of CS, Tsinghua Univeristy`

* System: Ubuntu 14.04 <br>
* Programming Language: c++/lua

In this project, I transfered style of one photographer to another image. Inputs are many images from one photographer and one test image. We use crawler to get images from flickr and train a neural network to extract style of the photographer.

* Implemented advanced colorization algorithm <br>
* Used CRF method to solve the problem of color bleeding during the transfer <br>
* Trained a new neural network to smooth the result

## Image and Video Matting in Real-Time

`3/2016 - 6/2016` <br>
`Lab work, advised by Songhai Zhang, Department of CS, Tsinghua Univeristy`

* System: Mac OS X 10.12 <br>
* Programming Language: c++

In this project, I used an input image including a person and its trimap to extract the person to a very fine degree.

* Constructed a pipeline to automatically generate trimap, to think over both local and nonlocal methods and the latter consists of sampling-based and affinity-based matting(`my work`), and to speed up with GPU.
* Improved the algorithm by using the expanded regions to accelerate computing speed

## An Augmented Reality Technology based on Hand Recognition

`3/2015 - 6/2015`
`33rd Challenge Cup`

* System: Windows 8 <br>
* Programming Language: c++/qt

In this project, we developed an AR system(also a headset product) integrating camera, computer and projector allowed users to control electronic appliances and play games on the papers, walls or some other normal places.

**Camera**: Detect user inputs, mainly are hand posture information <br>
**Computer**: Handle user inputs(image preprocessing and hand recognition) and generate feedback user wants(e.g. open a video) <br>
**Projector**: Project the virtual information generated by computer to the real world(e.g. Wall/Paper/Curtain) <br>
**Human**: Use hands to click or drag something

This's a diagram showing the structure of our system.

This is our poor equipment(lack of beauty, but not heavy).

Our product, due to its excellent innovation and practicability, won prizes in the 33rd Challenge Cup of Tsinghua, the Huawei Special Award (5/400), and the EMC Special Award (3/400).
