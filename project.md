## Motion Capture and Character Animation

`3/2017 - `

In this project we capture human motion from a video and then embed it into a static 3D scan human body to make this body move. Hopefully I can put this moving character into VR HMD. This is amazing!!! I am working now!!!
To be continued...

## Pose Imitation of Robot in ROS System

`7/2016 - 9/2016`

Developed a pose estimation system with binocular camera in ROS platform and make robot to perform simulations of human movement in real-time.
Proposed an algorithm to locate people, match ICP, extract skeleton and compute similarity.
Implemented a 3D body model composed of 10 main body parts to improve results.

## Neural Color Transfer

`9/2016 - ` <br>
`Advised by Songhai Zhang, Department of CS, Tsinghua Univeristy`



## Image and Video Matting in Real-Time

`3/2016 - 6/2016` <br>
`Advised by Songhai Zhang, Department of CS, Tsinghua Univeristy`



## An Augmented Reality Technology based on Hand Recognition

`3/2015 - 6/2015`

In this project we developed an AR system(also a headset product) integrating camera, computer and projector allowed users to control electronic appliances and play games on the papers, walls or some other normal places.

This's a diagram showing the structure of our system.

*Camera*: Detect user inputs, mainly are hand posture information <br>
*Computer*: Handle user inputs(image preprocessing and hand recognition) and generate feedback user wants(e.g. open a video) <br>
*Projector*: Project the virtual information generated by computer to the real world(e.g. Wall/Paper/Curtain) <br>
*Human*: Use hands to click or drag something

This is our poor equipment(lack of beauty, but not heavy).

Our product, due to its excellent innovation and practicability, won prizes in the 33rd Challenge Cup of Tsinghua, the Huawei Special Award (5/400), and the EMC Special Award (3/400).
