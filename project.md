## Motion Capture and Character Animation

In this project we capture human motion from a video and then embed it into a character.





I am working now!!!

## Pose Imitation of Robot in ROS System



## Neural Color Transfer



## Image and Video Matting in Real-Time



## An Augmented Reality Technology based on Hand Recognition
In this project, we developed an AR system(also a headset product) integrating camera, computer and projector allowed users to control electronic appliances and play games on the papers, walls or some other normal places.

This's a diagram showing the structure of our system.

Camera: Detect user inputs, mainly are hand posture information <br>
Computer: Handle user inputs(image preprocessing and hand recognition) and generate feedback user wants(e.g. open a video)
Projector: Project the virtual information generated by computer to the real world(e.g. Wall/Paper/Curtain)
Human: Use hands to click or drag something

This is our poor equipment(lack of beauty, but not heavy).

Our product, due to its excellent innovation and practicability, won prizes in the 33rd Challenge Cup of Tsinghua, the Huawei Special Award (5/400), and the EMC Special Award (3/400).
